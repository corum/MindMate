Themes allow us to apply a common formatting across all nodes, canvas and note editor. 

Three key functionalities available in Format menu related to themes are:
- Apply one of the built-in themes
- Create custom theme using 'Set Default Format' dialog
- Set the formatting of the selected node as the default.
