Themes allow us to apply a common formatting across all nodes, canvas and note editor. 

Three key functionalities available in Format menu related to themes are:
- Apply one of the built-in themes
- Create custom theme using 'Set Default Format' dialog
- Set the formatting of the selected node as the default.

### Create custom theme
A custom theme can be created from Default Format dialog. It is available from 'Format' menu.

Any changes to Default Format will apply to the currently open map. Each map has it's own default format.

In Format menu, there is also an option to set the formatting of the selected node as the default formatting of the map.
