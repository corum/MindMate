Theme allows us to apply a common formatting across all nodes, canvas and note editor. 

Three key functionalities available in *Format* menu related to themes are:
1- Apply one of the built-in themes
2- Create custom theme using 'Set Default Format' dialog
3- Set the formatting of the selected node as the default.
